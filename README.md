# EDA Project

This repo contains the files of the EDA project. 

After a quick analysis of the data we tried to build a model that satisfies the GLM (Gaussian Linear Model) assumptions with the given data to predict a variable (Y). 

We tried various techniques : 
  - Variable selection
  - Response transformation
  - Principal Componenet Analysis (PCA)
  - Higher order modelling
